MARK-II (unedited version).

#feel free to edit this game, expand this game anyway you like.

---
The game's name is "MARK-II", I finished it like uh... more than one year ago,
it's an action puzzle game, you control two characters, which are named Mark and Mark-II, they cooperate, solve puzzles, and clear stages together.

I made this game as a student work for attending Tokyo Game Show 2012 as a developer,
and finally wrapped it as a complete game at the end of 2012.

All programming, graphics( including 3D models, textures, animations, UI elements... ), music are made by myself.

You can view a portfolio I made before, with the PC-version released game download link.

I actually want this game to go further, so I am currently thinking about some more interesting game ideas.
As for this "MARK-II", I decided to public it on Github, although a lot of dirty codes are contained... but I really want to communicate and learn something, so don't make fun of me. XD
